Write a function to return the number of times a character appears in a string. The character can be the empty strinG?
def char_frequency(str1):
    dict = {}
    for n in str1:
        keys = dict.keys()
        if n in keys:
            dict[n] += 1
        else:
            dict[n] = 1
    return dict
print(char_frequency('google.com'))
